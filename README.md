The DriverPass project was an idea created by DriverPass who devised a system that would help people pass both the written and practical driving tests.  The project consisted of creating activity diagrams, sequence diagrams and UML’s the show the client how the project would look from a technical perspective.  We also created business requirements and created a presentation in non-technical terms, for the business, to allow them to also understand how we planned on proceeding in the project.  

I think where I did my best was creating system design documents and coming up with business requirements.

Where I lacked and need to improve is creating UML’s that have all the correct classes with symbols and all, I am improving but have a way to go.

The way I interpreted the user’s needs and implemented them into my design system design was to carefully analyze the transcript we were given of the interviews and took the key things they requested and added them to the system.  Items such as the user being able to view progress in their learning and being able to take practice tests.  Meetings the clients need by interpreting what they say is critical no matter how great a project is, if it is not what the client asked for, it is useless.

I approach designing software by first understanding what it is I am trying to accomplish and next understanding what it takes to accomplish it, step by step, I have learned you cannot just great a whole project from start, you need to take it like writing a book, chapter by chapter.
